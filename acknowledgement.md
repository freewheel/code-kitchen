This library was started by searching for a custom solution for embedding React component demos which are closed source in FreeWheel private networks.

We explored the following libraries and sites in the journey:

- [New React Docs](http://beta.reactjs.org/) / [Sandpack](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/)
- [Semi Design](https://semi.design/en-US/) / [react-live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live)
- [Fluent UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web)

The in browser bundler is inspired by [play-esbuild](https://github.com/egoist/play-esbuild).
